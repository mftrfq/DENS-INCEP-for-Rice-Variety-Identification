## ðŸŒ¾ Overview

This repository hosts the source code and resources for a deep learning project focused on the **accurate identification and classification of different rice varieties** from image data.

This project specifically implements and evaluates a custom **Transfer Learning architecture named DENS-INCEP**, which combines features from established Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high performance in agricultural classification tasks.

## ðŸ“– Background & Motivation

The accurate and rapid identification of rice varieties is crucial for quality control, breeding programs, and agricultural management. Manual identification is time-consuming and often subjective.

This work serves as the practical implementation for the research paper:

> **"Rice Variety Identification Based on Transfer Learning Architecture Using DENS-INCEP"**
> **Published in IEEE Access (DOI: 10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562585)**

We utilize the power of **Transfer Learning** to leverage models pre-trained on vast image datasets, fine-tuning them to the specific domain of rice variety recognition, thereby maximizing efficiency and classification accuracy.

## âœ¨ Key Features

* **DENS-INCEP Architecture:** Implementation of the proposed hybrid architecture combining **DenseNet** and **Inception** blocks.
* **Transfer Learning Implementation:** Scripts for loading pre-trained weights and fine-tuning the model on a custom rice image dataset.
* **High Accuracy:** Focus on achieving superior classification metrics for practical field application.
* **Data Preprocessing Pipeline:** Robust scripts for image normalization, augmentation, and data loading.

## ðŸ’» Technology Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Frameworks:** TensorFlow / Keras (or PyTorch, *sesuaikan dengan yang Anda gunakan*)
* **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebooks / Python Scripts
